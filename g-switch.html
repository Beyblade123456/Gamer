        G-Switch is an incredibly simple game, you merely have to focus on timing and only one button is required. There will be a bionic type man running along platforms with holes in them, there will be some over head and some under foot. When you left click, the gravity will change and your character will start running on the top platform, upside down. Sounds simple enough... however each level becomes progressively harder and you will end up dying several times on the same stretches of the course before you complete a level.

Apart from always being alert to whether your character should be running on the ceiling or ground, there are also areas of the courses where your speed will change. Sometimes you will go slow, the problem with this is usually you will click the mouse too early, with it changing the timing. Other times you will go fast, the problem with this is you will get stuck behind a section of the wall and before you can think the screen has gone ahead of you and you've died. However these changes occur on the same stretches, so you will become use to them eventually.

There are two three types of game play that you can attempt:

Standard levels; one level, avoiding dangerous obstacles and making sure that gravity is pulling your character towards the floor - not falling down, or up. You must also be aware in shifts of speed that are unsuspectingly given throughout the course.

Endless; again one level, yet it never ends. The objective of this is plain and simple. Survive as long as you can to gain the highest possible score. There will be hundreds of difficult parts to the course that you must quickly adjust to on the spot, or else its game over and you will have to start again at the beginning.

Multiplayer; as many as six people may participate in a multiplayer tournament, playing through 6 different levels. The level will stop when either all players have died or a player(s) has completed the course. This is by far the most enjoyable game mode due to the competitiveness, and you won't quit until you're triumphant.

G-Switch is a fun, simple game. It can be played in multiplayer mode, you can gain a high score and you only need to press one button. It utilizes many of the key features required for a successful online game and provides at least a good half hour's enjoyment.

Another flash game that can be played online for free is Puzzle Bubble [http://www.freepuzzlebubble.com/] which features the dragons from Bubble Bobble. The challenge is to match 3 or more of a kind by firing gems out of a canon at a sloping ceiling of more gems.
