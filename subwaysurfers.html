        Subway Surfers took the mobile gaming industry by storm when it launched in 2012. Since then the game has been quite popular amongst smartphone users looking to play one or two quick games in their free time to get their minds off of a stressing task at hand or just before sleeping.

In this game, your character races across the worlds train tracks, depending on the country that has been chosen for the most recent update. While racing, the character has to collect coins and mystery boxes, while at the same time trying to beat the high score set by you in the past or by your Facebook friends if you decide to link your account. With the coins, you can unlock new characters and boost upgrades.
